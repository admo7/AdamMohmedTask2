Please see the NeuralSignalCrossTalk.py file in both the Final-v1 and Final-v2 for 
slightly different solutions.

The difference being I've used a dictionary to help me with the solution in Final-v2.

Final-v1 runs slightly faster at just under 5mins.

I'm sure that having 3 for loops is causing the timesink, especially calculating the radius between two neurons for every single neuron, so I'd have to find an alternative.

Using a matrix would probably help, but I couldn't figure out how to do that without using numpy/scipy.

In the end I ran out of time trying to find an alternative.
